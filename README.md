# American-Option-Pricing-Binomial-Tree
American Option Pricing

•	Derived the limiting distribution (as the number of subperiods approaches infinity) of asset prices under physical and martingale probability measure induced by using the bank account and the asset as a numeraire respectively

•	Implemented the binomial tree model in Python to value an American put option and generated the optimal exercise boundary as a function of time

•	Used Monte Carlo simulation to simulate 10,000 sample paths of the asset price and obtained a kernel density estimate of P&L and exercise time distribution assuming a long position of the American put option
